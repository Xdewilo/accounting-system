An accounting system is a tool that records, processes, and manages all the financial operations of a company or business. Its main goal is to organize economic information, support decision-making, and ensure compliance with tax and accounting regulations. An accounting system automates tasks such as issuing invoices, tracking income and expenses, generating financial reports (like balance sheets and income statements), and monitoring accounts receivable and payable. It also provides up-to-date and accurate data to help evaluate economic performance and plan for organizational growth.
